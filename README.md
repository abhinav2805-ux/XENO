## AI Integration

### AI-Driven Message Suggestions

The platform integrates with **Groq LLM** to provide AI-powered message suggestions and analytics for campaigns.

- **Campaign Message Generation:**  
  When creating a campaign, users can click a button to "Enhance Message with AI".  
  The frontend sends the campaign name, description, and user-written message to a Next.js API route (`/api/llm/suggest-message`).
- **Order/Product Insights:**  
  Users can ask natural language questions about their uploaded orders (e.g., "Which product has the maximum sales?").  
  The frontend sends the prompt and the relevant `uploadId` to `/api/llm/product-analysis`, which uses Groq LLM to generate insights.
- **How it works:**  
  The backend constructs a prompt and calls the Groq LLM API using your `GROQ_API_KEY` from `.env`.  
  The generated message or insight is returned and displayed in the UI.

---

## Known Limitations & Assumptions

- **Google Auth:**  
  Currently, Google OAuth is implemented for authentication, but account linking between Google and credentials (email/password) is not automatic. Users must use the same method they registered with.
- **AI Features:**  
  AI integration is focused on campaign message enhancement and product/order analytics. Other advanced AI use cases (e.g., natural language to segment rules, performance summarization) are not yet implemented.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Basic error handling is present, but more granular user feedback and comprehensive backend logging could be improved.


---

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Channel Delivery:**  
  Extend delivery capabilities beyond simulated SMS to include email, WhatsApp, push notifications, and in-app messages.
- **Advanced Dashboard:**  
  Build a dashboard with live tracking of campaign performance, customer engagement, and delivery heatmaps.
- **More AI Features:**  
  Integrate additional AI-powered features such as natural language to segment rules, MongoDB-powered message suggestions, and campaign performance summarization.
- **Enhanced UX/UI:**  
  Add more interactive and user-friendly elements to the interface.
- **Automated Testing:**  
  Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- **Improved Error Handling:**  
  Enhance error handling and system logging for better reliability and maintainability.
